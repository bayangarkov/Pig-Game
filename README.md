# Pig Game

A fun game which I made in a 'follow along' mode in one of the Udemy courses by Jonas Schmedtmann.


## Instructions

The game simulates a 2 players rolling dices.<br>
One player can roll a dice and it can "hold" the points and then is the next person's turn.<br>
If player rolled 1 it loses all the accumulated points and it cannot "hold" them.<br>
The player who collect 100 points is the winner.<br>
